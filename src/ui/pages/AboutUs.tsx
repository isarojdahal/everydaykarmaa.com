            EverydayKarma first came to life in 2018, sparked by a simple
            request from a friend who needed help with C programming. Instead of
            teaching just him, I thought, Why not share this knowledge with
            everyone? That's when I created my first video and uploaded it to
            YouTube.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since then, content has been consistently shared, evolving and
            growing over time.

            But truth be told, the journey hasn't been easy. The original
            channel no longer existsâ€”this is actually the fourth version of
            EverydayKarma. Challenges like AdSense issues and copyright claims
            (from other channels) forced me to start over multiple times.

            Despite the hurdles, we've built a resilient and thriving community.
            Today, we're a growing family of 3.5K+ subscribers, and this is just
            the beginning.
